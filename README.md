this is my first project as a 16 year old. this is just a basic (and terrible) calculator built in python using kivy. feel free to copy code if you want or need. the image asset was created by me, use it, i dont really care.

the point of this app is to basically be a standard calculator and make fart noises everytime you click a button

you will need python and the kivy extension for this
