this is my first project as a 16 year old. ngl this is just a basic (and terrible) calculator built in python using kivy. feel free to copy code if you need. pretty sure the sounds might still be protected under copyright so i would be careful if you actually want to use them for some reason. the image was created by me, use it, i dont really care.



so basically i created this to add to my cv to help my chances of getting a job because yk.

i was also pretty bored upon making this

the point of this app is to basically be a standard calculator and make fart noises everytime you click a button

you will need python and the kivy extension for this

and are believed to fall under fair use for nonprofit purposes. If there are any concerns regarding the use of these
