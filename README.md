this is my first project as a 16 year old. ngl this is just a basic (and terrible) calculator built in python using kivy. feel free to copy code if you need. pretty sure the sounds might still be protected under copyright so i would be careful if you actually want to use them for some reason. the image was created by me, use it, i dont really care.



so basically i created this to add to my cv to help my chances of getting a job because yk.

i was also pretty bored upon making this

the point of this app is to basically be a standard calculator and make fart noises everytime you click a button

you will need python and the kivy extension for this
